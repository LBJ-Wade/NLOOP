# NLOOP
_Documents are objects, so let's treat them as such..._


**NLOOP** is a python package that provides a convenient interface for
 processing, analyzing, and modeling text data using popular natural language
  processing libraries such as [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), and sometimes [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)! 

Install NLOOP by running the following in the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syasini/NLOOP.git

cd NLOOP

pip install [-e] .
```

_NOTE_: Don't forget the `.` at the end! 
The `-e` argument will install the package in editable mode which is suitable
 for developement. Since currently the code is being regularly updated
 , using this option is recommended. 

_(optional)_

If you use conda, consider creating a new environment prior to the previous steps to ensure a clean installation of NLOOP:

```bash
conda create -n nloop_env python=3.7

conda activate nloop_env
```
